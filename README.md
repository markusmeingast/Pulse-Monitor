# pulse-monitor
Concept work for a heart beat monitor to determine intermittent arrhythmia. 

## 01.06.2019
Starting basic setup work for Arduino **Nano** (C-Control compatible board) and Raspberry **Pi** 3 B+.
 - Added "blink" example as placeholder to Nano
 - Set up python 3.7.3 on Pi

## Open Topics
 - Serial read frequency (DAQ and transfer should be min ~50Hz)
 - Tensorflow lite model transfer (CPU/GPU --> ARM)
 - Sensor setup on Raspberry
 - Beat splitting method
 - Buffering
